**C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets

CSS describes the **visual style and presentation** of the **content written in HTML**.

CSS consists of countless **properties** that developers use to format the content: properties about font, text, spacing, layout, etc.

```css
/* h1 is the selector on which we want to apply the style */
h1 {
  color: blue;
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 20px;
}
```
