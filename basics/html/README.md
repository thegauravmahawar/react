HTML is a markup language used to **structure and describe the content** of a webpage.

HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, videos, etc.

> When we think about HTML, we should not only think about how it actually looks like in the browser but even more what these elements actually mean.

Search engines, such as Google will be able to understand the structure of your content, and therefore, they will be better able to analyze what your content and what your webpage is all about. Also, writing semantic HTML is extremely important for accessibility, and especially for people who rely on screen readers to consume our webpages.
